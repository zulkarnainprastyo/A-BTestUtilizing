# Outline

# Project Background 
The main objective of the experimental design and A/B testing course is to prepare you in making experimental designs and conducting A/B testing and conducting A/B testing to solve a problem.

Through this project, you will be asked to
 * Create an A/B testing plan
 * Perform A/B testing analysis from the given dataset

# Project Stages
    Stage #1 - Choose Cases
    Stage #2 - Setting Up Problem
    Stage #3 - Designing Experiments
    Stage #4 - Running Experiment and Obtaining Data
    Stage #5 - Analyzing and Interpreting the Data
    Stage #6 - Make Conclusion and Recommedentation
    Stage #7 - Make Easy Report and Presentation

# Outcome Project
